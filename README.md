Developers used [Trello]() to get things organized, each one using their own branch to code, using names to identify the commit type then merginng the features into develop branch. After testing, the group update the main branch. This application was developed in xx/xx/20xx until xx/xx/20xx.

### Tools Used 🛠️: 

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). 
- [VIM](https://www.vim.org/).
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
