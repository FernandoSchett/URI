## About ü§î:

This repository serves as a storage for my studies, codes, and materials related to competitive programming. My main intention is to participate in famous programming marathons in Brazil, and this repository supports my preparation for those events.

The repository includes solutions to coding questions from platforms such as [BeeCrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/login), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and other popular platforms for competitive programming. It serves as a centralized location to store my progress, track improvements, and access study materials. I aim to sharpen my programming abilities and improve my performance in competitive programming competitions.

By organizing and maintaining this repository, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills, learn different algorithms and techniques, and stay updated with the programming challenges faced in competitive environments.

Some of the notable programming marathons in Brazil that I aspire to participate in include ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest), Maratona de Programa√ß√£o da SBC (Brazilian Computing Society Programming Marathon), OBI (Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics) and POSCOMP (National Exam for Admission to Graduate Studies in Computing). These events provide valuable opportunities to test my skills, collaborate with teammates, and showcase my programming abilities on a national or international stage.

## Dependencies üöö:

In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the all codes in this repository:

- none yet :p
- 

For installing dependencie, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

    pip3 install -r dependencies/requirements.txt

## How to run these codes üèÉ:

First, clone this repository. In the top of each code file, has a manual with instructions for compiling, running, its porpouse and other information. They usually look like the template below:

	/*
	File:           filne_name.ext
	Last changed:   xx/xx/20xx xx:xx
	Purpose:        Code for hard problems         
	Authors:        Fernando Ant√¥nio Marques Schettini   
	Usage: 
		HowToCompile:   gcc filne_name.cpp -o file_name
		HowToExecute:   ./file_name           
	*/ 

## Development Process ‚öôÔ∏è:

During the period leading up to the SBC programming marathon, i followed an informal development process without any specific methodology. Me and my focused on filling up the repository with relevant content to support our preparation.

To ensure effective collaboration and progress, we held weekly team meetings. These meetings provided a platform for us to discuss and plan our activities, set goals, allocate tasks, and track our progress. The regularity of these meetings significantly increased the frequency of updates and contributions to the repository.

### Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è:
